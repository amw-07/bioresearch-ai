## 🎯 Overview

This system automates the lead generation process for businesses selling 3D in-vitro models and related technologies to biotech and pharmaceutical companies. It combines data from multiple sources, applies intelligent scoring, and presents actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

### The Problem

Business development teams spend weeks manually:
- Searching for potential leads on LinkedIn and publications
- Gathering contact information and company details
- Prioritizing prospects based on gut feeling
- Managing spreadsheets of unstructured data

### The Solution

This automated system:
- **Identifies** leads from PubMed publications, LinkedIn, and conferences
- **Enriches** data with contact info, funding status, and publications
- **Scores** each lead (0-100) based on propensity to purchase
- **Prioritizes** prospects automatically for maximum ROI

**Result:** Weeks of manual work reduced to minutes with data-driven prioritization.

## 🧮 Scoring Algorithm

### Propensity Score Calculation

Each lead receives a score from **0-100** based on four weighted factors:

```
Total Score = Role Fit (30%) + Recent Publication (40%) + Funding (20%) + Location (10%)
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. Role Fit (30 points max)

**What we measure:**
- Job title contains toxicology/safety keywords
- Seniority level (Director, VP, Head)
- Relevance to 3D models and in-vitro research

**Scoring:**
- **Full Score (30 pts)**: "Director of Toxicology", "Head of Safety Assessment"
- **High Score (24 pts)**: "Principal Scientist - Hepatic", "VP Preclinical Safety"
- **Medium Score (18 pts)**: "Senior Scientist", "Research Associate"
- **Low Score (6 pts)**: "Research Scientist II", "Scientist I"

**Bonus:** +20% for senior roles (Director, VP, Head, Chief)

#### 2. Recent Publication (40 points max)

**What we measure:**
- Published papers in last 2 years
- Relevance to DILI, 3D models, toxicology
- Authorship position (corresponding author = budget holder)

**Scoring:**
- **Full Score (40 pts)**: Published 2023-2024 on DILI/3D models
- **High Score (32 pts)**: Published 2023-2024, less relevant topic
- **Medium Score (20 pts)**: Published 2020-2022
- **Low Score (4 pts)**: No recent publication

#### 3. Company Funding (20 points max)

**What we measure:**
- Funding stage indicates budget availability
- Series A/B/C companies are prime buyers
- Public companies have established budgets

**Scoring:**
- **Full Score (20 pts)**: Series A, B, or C funding
- **High Score (16 pts)**: Public/IPO (established budgets)
- **Medium Score (8 pts)**: Seed/Early stage
- **Low Score (4 pts)**: Unknown funding

#### 4. Strategic Location (10 points max)

**What we measure:**
- Proximity to biotech hubs enables in-person meetings
- Major hubs have dense networks and ecosystem

**Scoring:**
- **Full Score (10 pts)**: Cambridge MA, Boston, Bay Area, Basel
- **Medium Score (6 pts)**: Seattle, San Diego, Oxford UK, London
- **Low Score (2 pts)**: Other locations (remote work still valuable)

### Priority Tiers

Leads are automatically categorized:

- 🟢 **High Priority (70-100)**: Immediate outreach recommended
- 🟡 **Medium Priority (50-69)**: Qualified leads for nurture campaign
- 🔴 **Low Priority (0-49)**: Long-term nurture or deprioritize

### Example Scores

| Lead Profile | Role | Pub | Fund | Loc | **Total** | Priority |
|-------------|------|-----|------|-----|-----------|----------|
| Director of Toxicology @ Series B biotech in Cambridge, published on DILI 2024 | 36 | 40 | 20 | 10 | **106 → 95** | 🟢 High |
| Senior Scientist @ Public pharma in Boston, published 2021 | 24 | 20 | 16 | 10 | **70** | 🟢 High |
| Research Scientist @ Seed startup in Texas, no publications | 18 | 4 | 8 | 2 | **32** | 🔴 Low |

### PubMed Integration Details

**How it works:**
1. Search PubMed with relevant queries (e.g., "DILI 3D models")
2. Retrieve recent papers (last 2-3 years)
3. Extract corresponding authors (usually PI with budget)
4. Parse affiliations for company/institution
5. Create lead profile with publication data
6. Calculate propensity score

**Rate Limits:**
- 3 requests per second without API key
- 10 requests per second with API key (free)

**Example Query:**
```python
from src.data_sources.pubmed_scraper import PubMedScraper

scraper = PubMedScraper(email="your.email@example.com")
leads = scraper.search_authors(
    query="drug-induced liver injury 3D models",
    max_results=50,
    years_back=2
)
```

## 📊 Examples

### Example 1: Finding High-Priority Leads

```python
# Using the scoring module programmatically
from src.scoring.propensity_scorer import PropensityScorer
import pandas as pd

# Create lead
lead = pd.Series({
    'title': 'Director of Toxicology',
    'recent_publication': True,
    'publication_year': 2024,
    'company_funding': 'Series B',
    'location': 'Cambridge, MA'
})

# Score it
scorer = PropensityScorer()
score = scorer.calculate_score(lead)
print(f"Propensity Score: {score}/100")  # Output: 95/100

# Get explanation
explanation = scorer.explain_score(lead)
print(explanation)
```

### Example 2: Batch Processing

```python
# Score multiple leads at once
from src.database.db_manager import DatabaseManager
from src.scoring.propensity_scorer import PropensityScorer

# Load leads from database
db = DatabaseManager()
leads_df = db.get_all_leads()

# Score and rank
scorer = PropensityScorer()
scored_df = scorer.score_batch(leads_df)

# Filter high-priority
high_priority = scored_df[scored_df['propensity_score'] >= 70]
print(f"Found {len(high_priority)} high-priority leads")
```

### Example 3: Custom Scoring Weights

```python
# Adjust weights for different campaigns
custom_weights = {
    'role_fit': 40,        # Emphasize role
    'publication': 30,     # Less focus on pubs
    'funding': 20,         # Same
    'location': 10         # Same
}

scorer = PropensityScorer(weights=custom_weights)
score = scorer.calculate_score(lead)
```

## 💬 FAQ

**Q: How accurate is the scoring algorithm?**
A: The algorithm provides data-driven prioritization. Accuracy improves with weight calibration based on your actual conversion data.

**Q: Can I use this for other industries?**
A: Yes! The modular design allows adaptation to any B2B lead generation use case. Modify scoring criteria and data sources accordingly.

**Q: How many leads can the system handle?**
A: Current SQLite setup handles 10,000+ leads efficiently. For enterprise scale (100,000+), migrate to PostgreSQL.

**Q: Is PubMed the only data source?**
A: Currently yes, but the system is designed for multiple sources. LinkedIn, Hunter.io, and Crunchbase integration is planned.

**Q: How often should I update lead data?**
A: Recommended: Weekly for high-priority leads, monthly for full database. PubMed updates daily.

**Q: Can I customize the scoring algorithm?**
A: Absolutely! Adjust weights in the UI or modify `propensity_scorer.py` for custom logic.
